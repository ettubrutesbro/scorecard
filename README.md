Yeah, the title is a mouthful....herein lies the source code for the scorecard project I undertook for Children Now. I worked on it with Nima Rahni (Design Manager at CN) and Ashley de Alba (Researcher) from approx. May '18 - Jan '19. Major technologies used: 

* React
* MobX
* styled-components
* Chroma.js
* SVG (vanilla, wish i got to play with CRA2's SVG import)
* React Flip Move 
* Storybook
